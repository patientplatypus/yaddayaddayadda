# What is this

This is an attempt to create a mobile chat application using <a href='https://www.flutter.io'>Flutter</a>. I will use a <a href='https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/bluetooth3.htm'>bluetooth piconet</a> on each device to create a connected mesh graph of local phones and then traverse the graph of each device when a message is sent. It may also be possible to use <a href='https://sidbala.com/h-264-is-magic/'>H.264</a> to send compressed images and videos. After MVP, it would be nice to have some location tagging based on common places around New York, and then create specific, joinable, rooms. For example, if you are with 100m of the Brooklyn Bridge you could join the Brooklyn Bridge "Room", which would have some specific styling associated with the bridge. Finally, I would like to have this working on both iOS and Android and available on each of the respective app stores.
